## Project Summary

Traditional protein sources struggle to meet the global demand due to the ever-growing population and sustainability concerns. The ZEST project proposes an innovative solution to this challenge: harnessing fungi-based protein production technologies.

The project focuses on optimising fermentation processes and using low-cost agricultural waste streams as feedstock to produce a variety of bio-based protein products, such as protein-enriched food and feed, as well as related bioproducts, including cosmetic ingredients.

ZEST will also foster a sustainable and secure food system in line with the EUâ€™s Farm to Fork Strategy.
